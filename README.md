# Welcome to Map Prompt Monday!

This is the official repository for #MapPromptMonday, a weekly social mapping project open to everyone.

The intent of Map Prompt Monday is to create a welcoming, supportive, and thoughtful community around producing and sharing maps on social media using the hashtag #MapPromptMonday. Everyone of all mapping abilities is welcome to participate! Participants should feel free to share their map creation(s) that are relevant to the weekly prompt, as well as to share any resources that could help aid others with the weekly topic.

# How Map Prompt Monday works

Each Monday will start a new prompt that will be the focus for the following week. You can make maps and compile resources you would like to share prior to the beginning of the prompt, but the idea is to share maps and other related resources during the week of the provided prompt. Given the #MapPromptMonday name you are encouraged to share on each Monday! However, knowing life circumstances will not make posting on Monday possible for everyone, you are also encouraged to share your maps and resources throughout the week of the current prompt so that we can be more inclusive and encourage participation for all!

Prompts will take a variety of forms, but they will be designed with the goal that anyone at any skill level can engage with them. For example, a prompt might focus on making a map with hexagons or to make a map based on a theme like population. As one goal is to use this project to help map makers become more thoughtful about the maps they make, occasional prompts will also focus on issues such as map accessibility (for example: make a colorblind friendly map) or similar topics. To help everyone have the ability to improve their map making skills, you can find a list of free additional resources on various mapping and cartographic topics that will continue to be added to over time [in the AdditionalResources folder](https://github.com/MapPromptMonday/MapPromptMonday/tree/main/AdditionalResources).

To accommodate a variety of work schedules and abilities, the weekly prompts for each month will be posted here on GitHub and announced on social media at least one week before the start of each month. For example: map prompts for each week in February will be released no later than January 25.

See more information about how Map Prompt Monday will operate in the Frequently Asked Questions section at the end of this README file.

# Map Prompt Monday Guidelines

Everyone is welcome to participate, but please follow these guidelines:
1) Be supportive and kind to everyone participating.
2) Please refrain from providing negative or critical unsolicited comments on another person’s map unless a person has indicated in their post they are open to feedback. If a person has mentioned they are open to comments, please keep comments positive, constructive, and how you envision the map might be improved.
3) Make sure to include a picture of your map when you post it, and please add alt text to your posts. You can learn more about alt text and ideas for crafting good alt text in the section called Please Use Alt Text below.
4) Please consider sharing information about the software or other tools you used to create your map, any code you used to create your map, and a general workflow of how you created your map to help others learn who might wish to emulate your map or style. You are not required to share any supplemental resources, but others may appreciate learning from your work.
5) Please only post maps you have made using the #MapPromptMonday hashtag. However, feel free to reshare with attribution any other maps with this hashtag.
6) Give credit to the data sources you use to create your map whenever possible

A tip of the hat to #30DayMapChallenge and #TidyTuesday for providing inspiration to start this project and templates for how to begin operating.

# Please Use Alt Text

Please add alt text (alternative text) to all of your posted maps for #MapPromptMonday

You can find [Twitter guidelines here](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions) how to add alt text to your images

> ### Here is a simple formula that can help you quickly generate alt text for your map:
> 
> Alt Text = “Map of location that shows type of data. Primary takeaway from map.”
>
> #### “Map of”
> 
> You can also be more specific here by describing the type of map, such as choropleth or raster satellite image
> 
> #### “location”
> 
> Describe the location and scale of your map. Is it the United States, Illinois, Chicago, or the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago?
> 
> #### “type of data”
> 
> Explain what data is being shown by the map
> 
> #### "Primary takeaway from map"
> 
> Summarize in a sentence what you most want the reader to know about what the map shows
>
> ### Example

> 
> Alt Text Example for the Map Above: "A world map showing production of tea leaves by country. China and India are the world leading producers of tea."

# Map Prompt Monday Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a list of questions you might have about #MapPromptMonday and answers for each one

##### Q: I’m intimidated by all the beautiful maps because I’m not really a cartographer. Should I even do this?
A: Yes, we hope you join us! We encourage people of all mapping abilities and levels to post their maps! Maps can still have important stories to tell and be great conversation-starters even if they are not deemed to be aesthetically pleasing by someone who claims to be a cartographer. We want Map Prompt Monday to be a community where anyone feels safe sharing their maps and being comfortable.

##### Q: Can I make multiple maps for a prompt and post them?
A: Absolutely! Make as many maps as you want for each prompt. We assume most people who participate for a chosen week will create one or two maps to practice their skills on that specific prompt, but there is no limit to how many maps you make. Just make sure they are your original creations!

##### Q: I want to post a map I made that’s relevant to the prompt this week
A: Awesome! Please at minimum do the following things before you post your map. One: Include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter (or other platform) and in the text of your post use the #MapPromptMonday hashtag so we can all quickly and efficiently access your map! Two: please add alt text (also known as alternative text) to your map image so that we are inclusive to all social media users! See the section Please Use Alt Text above.

##### Q: I want to post a web page or other online accessible resource that’s relevant to the prompt this week
A: Great! Please remember to include a link to the resource in your post. Also, please only post free and openly accessible resources so everyone has the ability to access them.

##### Q: I want to post a map or resource that’s not relevant to the prompt this week
A: I’m glad you are enthusiastic, but please either save the maps or resources for another week when they are relevant, or feel free to post the resource on your own but without the #MapPromptMonday hashtag

##### Q: Do I need to sign up for anything?
A: Nope! Just share and/or enjoy the maps and cartography resources everyone is posting.

##### Q: How often should I participate?
A: Participate whenever and how often you want. The idea behind having the whole week for a prompt is so people have more time and flexibility to participate. However, you are not obligated to participate any week you don’t want to or don’t have the time or energy. 

##### Q: I have an idea for a map prompt to be done in the future!
A: Ideas for prompts are always appreciated and I want to hear them! Submit here:

##### Q: Am I restricted in the tools, technologies, or data I can use to create maps?
A: The short answer is no, you can use any tools or data to make your maps. There are a couple possible exceptions. One: a few prompts might focus on using a specific dataset or data provider. In that scenario, you can use other datasets in combination with the dataset chosen for the prompt, but at least one of your data layers used to create your map features should come from the chosen dataset. Two: please use your best judgement when choosing data sources and map visualizations by keeping data and map ethics in mind so that you are not inadvertently causing harm.
