## Week of June 26th to July 2 (Prompt = Plants)

#### Prompt: Your challenge for this week is to create a 'Plant-Tastic Map' about anything and everything plant-related. Your map can be as wide-ranging or as specific as you wish. You could show where different types of plants grow in your town, country, or around the world. Alternatively, you could map out the trees in your favorite park. The sky's the limit, as long as it’s plant-related!

## Please Use Alt Text (Resources)

Please add alt text (alternative text) to all of your posted maps for #MapPromptMonday

## Please Use Alt Text (Example)

> ### Here is a simple formula that can help you quickly generate alt text for your map:
> 
> Alt Text = “Map of location that shows type of data. Primary takeaway from map.”
>
> #### “Map of”
> 
> You can also be more specific here by describing the type of map, such as choropleth or raster satellite image
> 
> #### “location”
> 
> Describe the location and scale of your map. Is it the United States, Illinois, Chicago, or the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago?
> 
> #### “type of data”
> 
> Explain what data is being shown by the map
> 
> #### "Primary takeaway from map"
> 
> Summarize in a sentence what you most want the reader to know about what the map shows
