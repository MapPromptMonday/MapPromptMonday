## Week of January 16th to January 22nd (Prompt = Colorblind Friendly)

#### Prompt: Make a map on a topic of your choice, but that uses a colorblind friendly color scheme with at minimum two colors. In other words, the goal is for you to engage with multi-color schemes in your mapping that are colorblind friendly, rather than monochrome or single color maps (which also are usually colorblind friendly).

## Please Use Alt Text (Resources)

Please add alt text (alternative text) to all of your posted maps for #MapPromptMonday

## Please Use Alt Text (Example)

> ### Here is a simple formula that can help you quickly generate alt text for your map:
> 
> Alt Text = “Map of location that shows type of data. Primary takeaway from map.”
>
> #### “Map of”
> 
> You can also be more specific here by describing the type of map, such as choropleth or raster satellite image
> 
> #### “location”
> 
> Describe the location and scale of your map. Is it the United States, Illinois, Chicago, or the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago?
> 
> #### “type of data”
> 
> Explain what data is being shown by the map
> 
> #### "Primary takeaway from map"
> 
> Summarize in a sentence what you most want the reader to know about what the map shows
>
