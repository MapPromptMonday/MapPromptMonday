## Week of February 13th to February 19th (Prompt = Bivariate Map)

#### Prompt: Make a bivariate map on a topic of your choice. Bivariate maps, also known as choropleth maps, are maps that display two variables at once by using different colors or patterns to represent the different values. These maps can be used to show the spatial distribution of two variables and to identify patterns and relationships between them. Bivariate maps are commonly used in fields such as demographics, epidemiology, and economics to visualize data related to population density, income, crime rates, and other data. These maps should be used with care, as it can be difficult to distinguish patterns with too many variables and can lead to misinterpretation of the data.

#### Below are links for tutorials on creating bivariate maps in QGIS and R. Even if you do not plan to make your bivariate map with QGIS or R, both links provide great background information and guidelines about bivariate maps.

## Please Use Alt Text (Resources)

Please add alt text (alternative text) to all of your posted maps for #MapPromptMonday

## Please Use Alt Text (Example)

> ### Here is a simple formula that can help you quickly generate alt text for your map:
> 
> Alt Text = “Map of location that shows type of data. Primary takeaway from map.”
>
> #### “Map of”
> 
> You can also be more specific here by describing the type of map, such as choropleth or raster satellite image
> 
> #### “location”
> 
> Describe the location and scale of your map. Is it the United States, Illinois, Chicago, or the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago?
> 
> #### “type of data”
> 
> Explain what data is being shown by the map
> 
> #### "Primary takeaway from map"
> 
> Summarize in a sentence what you most want the reader to know about what the map shows
>
