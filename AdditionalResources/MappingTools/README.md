Below are just a small selection of packages frequently used for geospatial analyses:

[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/): simple features for R

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): creates graphics and can handle spatial features

[terra](https://rspatial.org/pkg/index.html): provides methods for vector and raster spatial data analysis

[tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html): for thematic mapping

[rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/): create 2D and 3D data visualizations
