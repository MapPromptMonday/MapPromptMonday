## Mapping Tools/Software

Below is a selection of *free open source mapping tools* available to anyone. However, map prompts can be completed using any type of tools/software, including without GIS/Mapping software or without a computer.

If you are looking for tutorials for many of these tools, [see the Tutorials & References Section](https://github.com/MapPromptMonday/MapPromptMonday/tree/main/AdditionalResources/Tutorials%26References)

### [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)

QGIS is a free and open source Geographic Information System software that you can install on your computer. QGIS provides you to tools to read and write multiple data formats and output a variety of map types.

### [Felt](https://felt.com/)

Felt is a website with basic map-making tools where you can use data on their website or bring in your own, then make a variety of edits and annotations.

### [R Geospatial Packages](https://www.r-project.org/)

R is a free command-line driven software originally designed for statistical computing and graphics, but many packages (or plug-ins) have been designed and can be accessed to provide an array of geospatial capabilities. Below are just a small selection of packages frequently used for geospatial analyses:

[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/): simple features for R

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): creates graphics and can handle spatial features

[terra](https://rspatial.org/pkg/index.html): provides methods for vector and raster spatial data analysis

[tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html): for thematic mapping

[rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/): create 2D and 3D data visualizations

[osmplotr](https://github.com/ropensci/osmplotr): produce maps using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data 

[cartography](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cartography/vignettes/cartography.html): control visual quality of thematic maps

### [Aerialod](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod)

Aerialod is path tracing renderer that can be used to create 3D visualizations

### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender provides a 3D creation suite of tools. You can also work on spatial data in Blender with the help of the [BlenderGIS add-ons](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS)
